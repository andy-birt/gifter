# Gifter

Gifter is an API built using .Net 5 with `UserProfile`, `Post`, and `Comment` resources that implements full CRUD functionality. 
It was built using [Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/). 

The [project](https://github.com/NewForce-at-Mountwest/bangazon-inc/blob/master/book-3-web-api/chapters/GIFTER.md) comes from the NewForce back end curriculum

ðŸ”´ This has not been tested in previous versions of Visual Studio.

Testing the API functionality can be done with the built-in testing tool Swagger UI when running the project in Debug mode or without 
just make sure to use a URL like `https://localhost:{port}/swagger/index.html` in your preferred browser. Swagger is really helpful for seeing which endpoints to use.
Otherwise you can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to test the API if you're into that.
